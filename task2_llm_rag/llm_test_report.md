Here's a simplified breakdown:<br><br>1. **Light-Dependent Reactions**  <br>   - Occur in the **thylakoid membranes** of chloroplasts.  <br>   - Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb sunlight, splitting water molecules into oxygen (released as waste), protons, and electrons.  <br>   - These reactions produce **ATP** (energy-rich molecules) and **NADPH** (electron carriers) using the energy from sunlight.<br><br>2. **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)**  <br>   - Takes place in the **stroma** of chloroplasts.  <br>   - Uses ATP and NADPH from the light reactions to fix carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) via the enzyme **RuBisCO**.  <br>   - The overall equation:  <br>     **6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**.<br><br>Photosynthesis sustains life by producing oxygen and forming the foundation of Earth's food chains. 🌿 |
