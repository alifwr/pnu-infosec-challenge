This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a gas phase. Note that this value can vary slightly with changes in pressure or altitude. |
| How does photosynthesis work? | Success | Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, alg... | Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy (usually from the sun) into chemical energy stored in glucose. Here's a simplified breakdown:<br><br>1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll in the plant's chloroplasts absorbs sunlight.<br>2. **Water Splitting**: Water (H₂O) is split into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and electrons. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.<br>3. **Carbon Dioxide Uptake**: Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere enters the plant through tiny pores called stomata.<br>4. **Chemical Reactions**: <br>   - **Light-dependent reactions** (in the thylakoid membranes) produce ATP and NADPH using light energy.<br>   - **Calvin cycle** (in the stroma) uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO₂ into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).<br><br>**Overall Equation**:  <br>6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂  <br><br>This process sustains plant life and forms the foundation of most food chains. |
